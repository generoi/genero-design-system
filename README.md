# Genero Design System

```sh
npm run build
```

## SASS library

There's no main entrypoint for all mixins, you are instead encouraged to encapsulate all dependencies in the files that they are used.

```scss
// Import component
@use '~genero-design-system/src/components/gds-button' as button;

.button {
  @include button.base;
}
```
